# Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

- Concerns with understanding and building intelligent entities.
- Machines that can compute how to act effectively in novel situations.

### Acting Humanly: The Turing Test

- Test:
  - Proposed by Alan Turing in 1950.
  - A human judge engages in a natural language conversation with one human and one machine, each of which tries to appear human.
  - If the judge cannot reliably tell which is which, then the machine is said to pass the test.
- Pitfalls:
  - Machine does not need to be intelligent to pass the test.
  - Human intelligence is not the only kind of intelligence.
- Components of AI suggested by Turing Test:
  - **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Understanding and generating human language.
  - **Knowledge Representation**: Storing and using knowledge.
  - **Automated Reasoning**: Inferring new facts from old ones.
  - **Machine Learning**: Adapting to new circumstances and detecting patterns.
  - **Computer Vision**: Perceiving objects.
  - **Robotics**: Moving and manipulating objects.

### Thinking Humanly: Cognitive Modelling

- Mimicking human thought processes.
- Requires:
  - Detailed understanding of human cognition.
  - Ability to implement this understanding in a computer program.
- Ways to determine human thought processes:
  - **Introspection**: Self-observation of one's own thoughts.
  - **Psychological experiments**: Observing humans in controlled environments.
  - **Brain imaging**: Observing brain activity during cognitive tasks.

### Thinking Rationally: Laws of Thought

- Thinking using logic or formal rules.
- Pitfalls:
  - **Limited to problems that can be formalized**: Many problems are not easily formalized.
  - **Computationally intensive**: Path of reasoning can be exhausting to compute.

### Acting Rationally: Rational Agent

- An agent that acts to achieve the best outcome or, when there is uncertainty, the best expected outcome.
- **Agent**: an entity that perceives and acts.
- **Rationality**: doing the right thing given what is known.

- Advantages:
  - **General applicability**: Rationality is not tied to human intelligence.
  - **Optimality**: Rational agents are optimal.
  - **Computationally feasible**: Rationality can be approximated.

## Overview

### The state of the art of AI

- **Speech Recognition**: Transcribing spoken language into text.
- **Robotic Vehicles**: Self-driving cars, drones, etc.
- **Recommendation Systems**: Recommending products, movies, etc.
- **Medical Diagnosis**: Diagnosing, especially from medical images is advanced.

### Limitations

- **Lack of general intelligence**: AI is good at specific tasks but lacks general intelligence.
- **Understanding context**: Not good at deep contexual understanding, especially when emotional intelligence and common sense are required.
- **Creativity**: Not good at creating new ideas.
- **Biases**: Can be biased based on the data it is trained on.
- **Ethics**: Can make unethical decisions based on the data it is trained on.
